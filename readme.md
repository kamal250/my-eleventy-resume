# My Forked Eleventy Resume
My name is Kamal Joshi, and this is my HTML resume, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
Thanks Michael for putting this on a repo and here is what he wrote more about this [on his website](https://michaelengen.com/posts/my-eleventy-resume/).

## How to Use

To build and host the one-page resume website:
```zsh
$ npm run build && npm run start
```

Then, create a PDF:
```zsh
$ node index.js
```
